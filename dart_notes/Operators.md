## Operators in Flutter (Dart)

Operators are the workhorses of any programming language, and Flutter, powered by Dart, is no different. They allow you to manipulate and compare data within your code. Here's a breakdown of some common operator categories in Dart:

* **Arithmetic operators:** Perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These include symbols like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.

* **Relational operators:** Compare values and return a boolean result (true or false). These include operators like `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), and `<=` (less than or equal to). 

* **Logical operators:** Combine conditional expressions. These include `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT).

* **Assignment operators:** Assign values to variables. The basic assignment operator is `=`, but there are shorthand versions for combining assignment with arithmetic operations (e.g., `+=` for add and assign, `-=` for subtract and assign).

* **Ternary operator:** A condensed way to write simple if-else statements. It follows the format `condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false`.
