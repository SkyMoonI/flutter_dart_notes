## Dart Concepts

This document provides a brief overview of some core concepts in the Dart programming language.

### Variables

* **Local variables:** Declared within a function and accessible only within that function.
* **Instance variables:** Declared within a class and accessible throughout the entire class.

### Built-in Types

* **int:** Stores integers (whole numbers).
* **double:** Stores floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals).
* **String:** Stores text.
* **bool:** Stores true or false values.
* **List:** Stores ordered collections of items (like arrays).
* **Map:** Stores unordered collections of key-value pairs (like dictionaries).
* **dynamic:** Underlying type for all Dart objects. Rarely used explicitly.
* **var:** Keyword replaced by the actual type of the variable during initialization.
* **Object:** Superclass of all Dart classes except Null.

### Functions

* **Named parameters:** Use curly braces `{}` to define parameters with specific names.
* **Optional positional parameters:** Use square brackets `[]` to define parameters that may or may not be provided.
* **main() function:** The entry point of a Dart program.
* **Functions as first-class objects:** Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.
* **Anonymous functions (lambdas or closures):** Functions without names, often used for concise code.
* **Tear-offs:** A shorthand for creating closures from existing functions.

### Operators

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on values.

* **Arithmetic operators:** Perform mathematical operations (+, -, *, /, etc.).
* **Relational operators:** Compare values and return boolean results (==, !=, <, >, etc.).
* **Logical operators:** Perform logical operations (AND: &&, OR: ||, NOT: !).
* **Assignment operators:** Assign values to variables (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.).
* **Ternary operator:** Shorthand for simple if-else statements (condition ? if_true : if_false).

### Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements dictate how your program executes.

* **if-else:** Executes code conditionally based on a boolean expression.
* **for loop:** Repeats a block of code a specific number of times.
* **while loop:** Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
* **do-while loop:** Similar to while loop, but executes the code at least once before checking the condition.
* **switch-case:** Executes different code blocks based on a value.
* **break:** Exits a loop prematurely.
* **continue:** Skips the current iteration of a loop and moves on to the next.
