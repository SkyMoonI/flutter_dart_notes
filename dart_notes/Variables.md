## Flutter Variables

In Flutter, variables are used to store data that your app uses. There are two main types of variables:

* **Local variables:** These are declared within a function and can only be accessed within that function's scope. They are typically used to hold temporary data specific to the function's execution.
* **Instance variables:** These are declared within a class and are accessible throughout the entire class instance. They are used to store data associated with a particular object.

Variables can store various data types, including:

* **Numbers (int, double):** Used for whole numbers (integers) and numbers with decimals (floating-point numbers).
* **Text (String):** Used for storing textual data.
* **True or False (bool):** Used for storing Boolean values (true or false).
* **Lists:** Used for storing ordered collections of items.
* **Maps:** Used for storing unordered collections of key-value pairs.
