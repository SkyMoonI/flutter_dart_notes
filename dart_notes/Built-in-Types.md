## Built-in Types in Flutter (Dart)

Flutter apps rely on Dart for functionality, and Dart provides various built-in types to store different kinds of data. Here's a breakdown of some commonly used types:

* **int:** Stores whole numbers (integers) without decimals. 
* **double:** Stores numbers with decimals (floating-point numbers).
* **String:** Stores textual data, like sentences or phrases.
* **bool:** Stores Boolean values, which can be either `true` or `false`.
* **List:** Used to store ordered collections of items. Imagine a shopping list where items have a specific order.
* **Map:** Used to store unordered collections of key-value pairs. Think of a phonebook where names (keys) are associated with phone numbers (values).
* **dynamic:** This is a less common type that can hold any kind of data. It's generally not recommended to overuse `dynamic` as it reduces type safety benefits in Dart.
* **var:** A shortcut for declaring a variable and letting Dart infer the type based on the assigned value.
* **Object:** The base class for all Dart classes except `Null`. 

Understanding these built-in types is crucial for working with data in your Flutter applications.
