Images
In Flutter, you can display images using the Image widget. There are several ways to add an image to your app:

* Asset: Add the image to your appâ€™s assets and specify the asset path in the Image widget.
* Network: Display an image from a URL by specifying the URL in the Image widget.
* File: Display an image from a file by specifying the file path in the Image widget.
  
The Image widget also accepts additional parameters such as fit, width, and height to control the size and scaling of the image.


To include, say, the first image, the pubspec.yaml of the application should specify it in the assets section:

flutter:
  assets:
    - packages/fancy_backgrounds/backgrounds/background1.png
    - 
The lib/ is implied, so it should not be included in the asset path.

If you are developing a package, to load an asset within the package, specify it in the pubspec.yaml of the package:

flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
