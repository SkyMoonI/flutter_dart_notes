Working with Assets
Assets are resources such as images, fonts, and other files that are included in your app. To use assets in Flutter, you need to specify them in your app’s pubspec.yaml file and then access them in your code.

Here’s how to work with assets in Flutter:

Add assets to your app’s pubspec.yaml file:
Access assets in your code
The pubspec.yaml file is used to manage dependencies, assets, and other settings in your Flutter app. The flutter section is used to specify assets that should be included with the app. The path specified in the assets section should be relative to the pubspec.yaml file.

Specifying assets
Flutter uses the pubspec.yaml file, located at the root of your project, to identify assets required by an app.

Here is an example:
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/my_icon.png
    - assets/background.png
    - 
To include all assets under a directory, specify the directory name with the / character at the end:
flutter:
  assets:
    - directory/
    - directory/subdirectory/
