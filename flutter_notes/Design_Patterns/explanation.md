* Patterns `will not generate` ready code for us, provide `a template` to follow a series of `formalized best practices` tested and verified by developers before us.

* There are common `23 patterns` explained by gang of four and split into `3 groups`.
    * Creational Design Patterns 
      * Factory Method
      * Abstract Factory
      * Builder
      * Prototype
      * singleton
    * Structural Patterns
      * Adapter
      * Bridge
      * Composite
      * Decorator
      * Facade
      * Flyweight
      * Proxy 
    * Behavioral Patterns
      * Chain of Responsibility
      * Command

      * Observer
      * State
      * Strategy
      * Template Method
      * Visitor

# Creational Patterns

* Creational Patterns provide more `flexibility` in how the `objects` are actually `created`
* Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase `flexibility and reuse of existing code`.

# Structural Patterns

* Structural Patterns deal with how `inheritance and composition` ca be used to `provide extra functionality`.
* These patterns explain how to `assemble objects and classes` into larger structures while keeping these structures `flexible and efficient`.

# Behavioral Patterns

* Behavioral Patterns are about `communication` and `assignment of responsibilities` between our objects.
* These patterns are concerned with `algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects`.
