**What is OOP?**

- `Primitive Data types` store single simple values.
Byte, int, float, boolean, double, char

- `The Structure` 
*  Stores many pieces of data 
*  CAN store different types of data
- The Array
*  Stores many pieces of data 
*  CANNOT store different types of data
The main issue with structures is that you cannot define functions within one.

- `Objects` are instances of a class. 
- `Classes` are templates for objects.
  
* Whereas the knight class represents any given knight, a knight object represents only one singular knight.
* Object oriented programming helps programmers create complex programs by grouping together related data and functions.
