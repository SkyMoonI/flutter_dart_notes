# Introduction

* Abstraction refers to `only showing essential details` and keeping everything else hidden. 

# Interface and Implementation

* The interface refers to the way sections of code can communicate with one another.
* This typically is done through methods that each class is able to access.
* The implementation of these methods, or how these methods are coded, should be hidden.
* If classes are entangled, then one change creates a ripple effect that causes many more changes.
* Creating an interface through which classes can interact ensures that each piece can be individually developed.

# Overview

* Abstraction `allows the program to be worked on incrementally` and prevents it from becoming entangled and complex.
* Determine `specific points of contact` that can act as an interface between classes, and `only worry about the implementation when coding it`.
