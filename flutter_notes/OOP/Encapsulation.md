# Introduction

* Encapsulation refers to `bundling data with methods` that can operate on that data within a class.
* Essentially, it is the idea of `hiding data` within a class, `preventing anything outside that class from directly interacting with it`.
* Members of other classes can `interact with the attributes of another object through its methods`.
* Remember, methods are the `functions defined within a class`.

# Methods

* Getting Methods = Retrieving information
* Setting Methods = Changing Information

* You may also want some attributes to be `read only` from the outside. To do this, you would `define a getter method`, but not a setter method. The variable could only be referenced. not changed

## Information Hiding

* It's generally best to not allow `external classes to directly edit an object's attributes`.
* Information hiding, or keeping the data of one class hidden from external classes, helps you keep control of your program and prevent it from becoming too complicated.

# Overview

* Encapsulation is a vital principle in OOP.
* Encapsulation:
  * Keeps the programmer in control of access to data,
  * Prevents the program from ending up in any strange or unwanted states.
