The `Image` widget in Flutter is used to display images from various sources within your app's user interface. It provides flexibility for loading images from assets, the internet (URLs), files, or even memory.

Here's an example code showcasing the `Image` widget with comment lines:

```dart
Image.network(
  'https://picsum.photos/250?image=999', // Replace with your image URL
  fit: BoxFit.cover, // Adjust how the image fills the container
  width: 200, // Set the width of the image
  height: 150, // Set the height of the image
  loadingBuilder: (context, loadingProgress, error) {
    if (error != null) {
      return Text('Error loading image!'); // Display error message
    }
    if (loadingProgress == null) {
      return Text('Image loaded!'); // Display success message (optional)
    }
    return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Display loading indicator
  },
),
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Image.network:** This constructor specifies that the image will be loaded from a network URL. Replace the provided URL with your desired image source.
2. **fit:** This property controls how the image is resized to fit within the available space. Here, `BoxFit.cover` ensures the entire container is filled while maintaining the image's aspect ratio.
3. **width & height:** These properties set the dimensions (in pixels) for the image widget.
4. **loadingBuilder:** This optional property defines how the widget behaves while the image is loading or if an error occurs.
    * In this example:
        * If an error occurs (`error != null`), it displays an error message.
        * If the image is successfully loaded (`loadingProgress == null`), you can optionally display a success message (commented out).
        * While the image is loading (`loadingProgress != null`), it displays a circular progress indicator.

**Additional Notes:**

* You can use other constructors for the `Image` widget like:
    * `Image.asset`: To load images from your app's asset bundle.
    * `Image.file`: To load images from a local file on the device.
    * `Image.memory`: To load images from a byte array in memory.
* Explore different `BoxFit` values like `BoxFit.fill` or `BoxFit.contain` to achieve various image resizing behaviors.
* Consider adding error handling and appropriate placeholders for a more robust user experience.

By using the `Image` widget and its properties, you can effectively incorporate images into your Flutter app's UI design.N
