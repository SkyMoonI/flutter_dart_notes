The `TextButton` widget in Flutter provides a versatile way to create simple, text-based buttons with a focus on clarity and accessibility. It's a lightweight alternative to other button types like `ElevatedButton` and `OutlinedButton`. Here's a breakdown of the `TextButton` widget with an example showcasing various properties:

**Key Features:**

* **Text-based Button:** Primarily uses text for the button label, promoting readability.
* **Customizable:** Offers various properties to control appearance and behavior.
* **Accessible:** Designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring usability for users with visual impairments.
* **Lightweight:** Less visually complex compared to other button types.

**Basic Usage:**

The most basic usage involves defining the `TextButton` with a `onPressed` callback and child widget (usually a `Text` widget):

```dart
TextButton(
  onPressed: () {
    print('Button clicked!');
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
),
```

This creates a simple button with the label "Click Me" that triggers a print statement when pressed.

**Example with Properties:**

This example demonstrates various properties for a more visually appealing and interactive `TextButton`:

```dart
TextButton(
  // Button action
  onPressed: () {
    print('You pressed the styled button!');
  },

  // Text and style
  child: Text(
    'Styled Button',
    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0, color: Colors.white),
  ),

  // Style properties
  style: ButtonStyle(
    foregroundColor: MaterialStateProperty.all(Colors.blue), // Text color
    backgroundColor: MaterialStateProperty.all(Colors.grey.shade200), // Background color
    padding: MaterialStateProperty.all(EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 15.0, vertical: 10.0)), // Padding
    shape: MaterialStateProperty.all(RoundedRectangleBorder(borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10.0))), // Rounded corners
  ),
),
```

**Explanation of Properties:**

* `onPressed`: A required callback function that defines the action triggered when the button is pressed.
* `child`: The widget displayed within the button, typically a `Text` widget for the button label. Here, it's styled with font size and color.
* `style`: This property allows you to configure various visual aspects of the button using `ButtonStyle`:
    * `foregroundColor`: Sets the text color of the button in all states.
    * `backgroundColor`: Defines the button's background color in all states.
    * `padding`: Adds padding around the button's content for better spacing.
    * `shape`: Controls the overall shape of the button (here, rounded corners with `RoundedRectangleBorder`).

**Additional Properties:**

The `TextButton` widget offers further customization options:

* `disabledColor`: Sets the button's background color when it's disabled.
* `focusColor`: Defines the button's background color when it receives focus.
* `hoverColor`: Controls the button's background color when hovered over (applicable on desktop platforms).
* `tapTargetSize`: Defines the minimum area for touch detection, ensuring easy interaction.
