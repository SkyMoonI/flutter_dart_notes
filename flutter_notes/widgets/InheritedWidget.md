The `InheritedWidget` class in Flutter serves as a foundation for sharing data across widgets within a subtree of the widget tree. It acts as a container that holds a piece of data and allows its descendants to access that data without explicitly passing it down through the widget hierarchy.

Here's a breakdown of the `InheritedWidget` class and an example showcasing its usage:

**1. Creating the InheritedWidget:**

```dart
class MyInheritedData extends InheritedWidget {
  final String title; // The data to be inherited

  const MyInheritedData({
    Key? key,
    required this.title,
    required Widget child,
  }) : super(key: key, child: child);

  // A static getter to access the current instance of MyInheritedData in the widget tree
  static MyInheritedData of(BuildContext context) {
    final inheritedData = context.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType<MyInheritedData>();
    if (inheritedData == null) {
      throw Exception("MyInheritedData not found in the context");
    }
    return inheritedData;
  }

  @override
  bool updateShouldNotify(MyInheritedData oldWidget) {
    return title != oldWidget.title; // Rebuild if the data has changed
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- This code defines a custom class `MyInheritedData` that extends `InheritedWidget`.
- It holds a property named `title` that represents the data to be inherited.
- The constructor takes a `child` widget and the `title` as arguments.
- The static `of` method allows descendant widgets to access the nearest instance of `MyInheritedData` up the widget tree. It throws an exception if not found.
- The `updateShouldNotify` method controls when the widget rebuilds its descendants. Here, it rebuilds if the `title` data changes.

**2. Using the InheritedWidget:**

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final title = MyInheritedData.of(context).title; // Access inherited data

    return Text(
      'Inherited Title: $title',
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: MyInheritedData(
        title: 'This is the inherited title!',
        child: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text('Inherited Data Example'),
          ),
          body: Center(
            child: MyWidget(), // Widget that accesses inherited data
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `MyWidget` class demonstrates how to access inherited data.
- It uses the static `of` method of `MyInheritedData` to retrieve the nearest instance's `title` property.
- The `MyApp` class wraps the `MyWidget` with `MyInheritedData`, providing the data to be inherited.

**Key Points:**

- Inherited widgets are useful for sharing data across a specific branch of the widget tree.
- They avoid the need to pass data down through multiple levels of widgets.
- Be cautious of overusing them, as complex data sharing might be better handled with state management solutions like Provider or Bloc.

**Additional Considerations:**

- The `updateShouldNotify` method is crucial to optimize rebuilds. It ensures descendants only rebuild when the inherited data they rely on actually changes.
