The `Card` widget in Flutter provides a versatile way to display information in a Material Design layout. It creates a surface with slightly rounded corners and an optional shadow effect, ideal for presenting grouped content like articles, product listings, or user profiles. Here's an explanation of the Card widget with an example code showcasing various properties:

**Explanation:**

1. **Card():** This line defines the widget as a `Card`.

2. **shape:** Controls the corner shape of the card. Here, we use `RoundedRectangleBorder` for rounded corners. You can also use `StadiumBorder` for a pill-like shape or `CircleBorder` for a circular card.

3. **margin & padding:**
    * `margin`: Adds empty space around the card itself, affecting its positioning relative to other elements.
    * `padding`: Adds empty space around the edges of the content within the card.

4. **elevation:** Defines the height of the shadow below the card, creating a 3D effect.

5. **shadowColor:** Sets the color of the shadow.

6. **child:** The most important property. It defines the widget that will be placed inside the card, representing the content you want to display.

**Example Code:**

```dart
Card(
  shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15.0), // Adjust corner radius
  ),
  margin: EdgeInsets.all(10.0), // Add margin around the card

  // Optional shadow effect
  elevation: 5.0,
  shadowColor: Colors.grey.withOpacity(0.5), // Shadow color with opacity

  child: Padding(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(20.0), // Add padding within the card

    // Card content (replace with your desired elements)
    child: Column(
      children: [
        Text(
          'Card Title',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 10.0), // Add vertical space
        Text(
          'This is a sample card with some content and properties applied.',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 10.0), // Add vertical space
        Row(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end, // Align to end
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                print('Button Clicked!');
              },
              child: Text('Action'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ),
),
```

**Explanation of Properties Used:**

* `RoundedRectangleBorder` with `borderRadius` defines the rounded corner style and radius.
* `margin` and `padding` control spacing around the card and its content, respectively.
* `elevation` and `shadowColor` create a subtle shadow effect.
* `Padding` is used within the `child` to add additional padding around the card's content.
* The `Column` widget allows you to stack elements vertically within the card.
* `SizedBox` with `height` adds vertical spacing between elements.
* The `Row` widget with `mainAxisAlignment` positions the `ElevatedButton` at the end of the card's content area.

**Additional Properties:**

The `Card` widget offers further customization options:

* `color`: Sets the background color of the card.
* `clipBehavior`: Controls how the child widget clips or overflows the card's bounds.
* `semanticContainer`: Makes the card act as a semantic container for accessibility purposes.
